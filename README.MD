# Local development

If you are developing on a Windows machine and have installed all dependencies, please use script `run_windows_local.ps1` to start you local development environment.

## Service layer (Python API backend)

1. Create new Python project with your favourite IDE.
2. Use _Pipenv_ for dependency management.
3. Clone the Github repo https://github.com/simachri/empathygame.
4. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies locally.
5. If you are using Windows and for example Powershell you need to set the environment variable:
```
# Set environment variable
$Env:PORT = "8080"

# Start python server
py ./api/main.py
```
6. This is an example launch configuration from PyCharm:

## UI layer

For the first time, add `@sap` to you npm and install all dependencies:

```
# Add @sap to your npm
npm config set @sap:registry https://npm.sap.com // Only the first time
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

After preparation you can start the application router by:

```
# Go to web folder
cd web
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The service is reachable on localhost:3000 where the api is accessable on localhost:3000/api and the ui is accessable on localhost:3000/ui.
